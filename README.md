# User Class in JavaScript

This repository contains a simple JavaScript class named `User`. The `User` class has a constructor that initializes a user with a `username`, `password`, and `email`. It also has four methods: `userData`, `onlyName`, `onlyPassword`, and `onlyEmail`, which log the user's details to the console.

## Installation

To use this code, simply clone the repository and open the JavaScript file in a JavaScript-compatible environment (like a web browser or Node.js).

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use the `User` class:

```javascript
let userRegistration = new user(
  "Brigetjones",
  "myglass123",
  "briget.jones@gmail.com"
);
-userRegistration.userData();
-userRegistration.onlyName();
-userRegistration.onlyPassword();
-userRegistration.onlyEmail();
```

When you run this code, it will log the user's details to the console.
